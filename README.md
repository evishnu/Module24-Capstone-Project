# Diabetes Readmission Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

This project analyzes the `diabetic_data.csv` dataset to predict patient readmission within 30 days. It covers data cleaning, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

---

## Executive Summary

Hospital readmissions, especially among diabetic patients, are a significant burden on healthcare systems both financially and in terms of patient care quality. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a patient with diabetes is likely to be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

Using a cleaned dataset derived from over 100,000 hospital encounters involving diabetic patients, we performed data preprocessing, feature selection, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling. The target variable is binary ‚Äî indicating whether a patient was readmitted within 30 days.

---

## Rationale

This project is driven by the need to reduce preventable readmissions among diabetic patients by leveraging historical healthcare data and machine learning. It aims to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce healthcare costs, and improve patient outcomes through early risk identification and targeted interventions.

---

## Research Question

**Can we accurately predict whether a diabetic patient will be readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge based on historical clinical and demographic data?**  
The goal is early identification of high-risk diabetic patients to reduce readmissions, improve patient outcomes, and optimize healthcare resource utilization.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Sources

A clinical dataset from the **Kaggle Repository** was used to evaluate diabetic patient readmissions within 30 days.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove irrelevant columns, drop duplicates.
- **Encoding**: Use One-Hot or Label Encoding for categorical features.
- **Scaling**: Normalize numerical features for models like SVM.
- **Class Balancing**: Use SMOTE or class weights to address class imbalance.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
- Analyze target class distribution.
- Feature relevance via distribution plots and correlation.

### 3. Modeling Techniques
- **Logistic Regression**: Baseline model
- **Decision Tree**: Easy to interpret
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for accuracy
- **XGBoost**: High-performance gradient boosting
- **SVM**: Effective in high-dimensional space

### 4. Model Evaluation
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 or cross-validation
- Metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision & Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC
  - Confusion Matrix

### 5. Model Comparison & Selection
- Use cross-validation and ROC curves
- Visual tools:
  - Confusion matrix plots
  - ROC-AUC curves
  - Feature importance

### 6. Model Interpretability
- Feature importance for tree-based models
- Optional SHAP values for interpretability

### 7. Deployment
- **Streamlit App**: Web UI for predictions
- **Model Serialization**: Save best model as `DIRAPR.pkl`

## Results

### 1. Model Performance
- **Best Model**: XGBoost or Random Forest
- **XGBoost Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: ~86%
  - ROC-AUC: ~0.88
  - Precision (Readmitted): ~0.81
  - Recall (Readmitted): ~0.85

### 2. Key Predictive Features
- `number_inpatient`
- `num_lab_procedures`
- `number_emergency`
- `time_in_hospital`
- `number_medications`
- `change`, `diabetesMed`, `insulin`

### 3. Clinical Insights
- Frequent hospital interactions ‚Üí high risk
- Medication changes signal acute health shifts
- Age & discharge disposition are moderate predictors

### 4. Operational Outcome
- Developed a Streamlit app:
  - Input patient data
  - Real-time risk prediction
  - Feature importance for transparency

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Model Enhancement
- Hyperparameter tuning (Bayesian)
- SHAP/ELI5 for interpretability
- Deep learning (LSTM) for sequential data

### 2. Data Expansion
- Add Social Determinants of Health (SDoH)
- Capture temporal visit trends
- Validate on external datasets

### 3. Clinical Integration
- Connect with EHR systems (Epic/Cerner)
- Embed in case manager workflows
- A/B test in real clinical settings

### 4. Monitoring & Feedback
- Build monitoring dashboard
- Gather clinician feedback

### 5. Scalability & Policy Impact
- Extend model to other chronic diseases
- Share findings to support value-based care models
